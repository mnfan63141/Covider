The programa should work on API versions from 21-32 on most devices. For my windows from 6 years ago
, however, it only worked on the nexus 4 with api 22. In other cases, it wouldn't change landscape
or it would fail to produce notes sometimes. A cp tried it on her machine and it should work on most
cases though except my laptop which might not have enough ram. 

I made the layout by manipulating the background and padding of the views in the layout file. I then
added listeners to all the views and played MediaPlayer instances matched to each sound file.
